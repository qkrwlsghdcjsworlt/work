<p>2.3.1 Relaxation</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Over time, the qubit will end up in thermal equilibrium with the
environment. It can exchange energy with the environment, changing
the polar angle \( \theta \) in the Bloch sphere representation. Any uncontrolled
change in energy will cause the loss of quantum information.
This can be measured by preparing the qubit in the excited state and
measuring the time it takes to go to thermal equilibrium. The decay
constant is generally called T1.</p>

<p>2.3.2 Dephasing</p>

<p>Information in the azimuthal angle Ï† on the Bloch sphere can also
be lost to the environment, without energy dissipation. This is called
dephasing. There is no classical equivalent for this. The loss of phase
can be measured by so called Ramsey Interferometry. The qubit is
initialized in the \( | 0 \rangle \) state and brought to the equator of the Bloch
sphere by a \( \pi /2 \)  pulse. After a time delay, a second \( \pi /2 \) pulse along
the same axis is applied and the qubit is measured along the \( z \)-Axis.
During the delay time, the qubit undergoes Lamor precession in the
energy subspace. The oscillations decay because of noise. The decay
constant of these oscillations is called \( T^{*2} \)</p>

<p>If the noise causing this dephasing is slow compared to qubit evolution
time, more elaborate sequences of pulses can be used to extend
the lifetime of the phase information. This goes by the name
of spin-echo sequences and was developed in the context of nuclear
magnetic resonance physics. Hence, the dephasing time dependends
on the pulse sequence. The upper limit is called T2.</p>
