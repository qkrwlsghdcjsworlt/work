Conyers Herring 1937 time reversal symmetry에 대한 PRL 논문 참 쉽지 않은 논문인데 time reversal symmetry operation 에 관한 문장을 보면 어렵게 묘사하고 있는 것을 확인할 수 있다.->

	The operation of taking the complex conjugate is to be interpreted as an operation which takes a wave function employed by one observer to describe some state of the system into a wave function which could be employed to describe the same physical state by an observer whose space axes conincide with those of the first, but whose time axis is oppositely directed.

Cohen 과 Falicov 가 지적했듯이 Herring 이 한것은 space group symmetry 와 time reversal symmetry의 합작으로 band sticking이 일어난다는 것이다.->
	
	A rigorous basis for the stcking together of the bands was provided by the symmetry properties and time-reversal arguments of Herring.
