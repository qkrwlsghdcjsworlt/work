Can a s orbital overlap with any of the three p orbitals (Px,Py, Pz) to form sigma bonds (according to Valence Bond Theory)?
Does the concept of overlapping of orbitals differ in 'valence bond theory' and 'molecular orbital theory'?

Absolutely! A sigma bond involves overlap that occurs along the axis that connects two nuclei. As the s orbital is spherical, there are infinite possibilities as to where the other atom can be located for successful overlap. On the other hand, p orbitals have cyllindrical symmetry. This means that to form a sigma bond, the p orbital has to point directly toward the other atom. Here is a picture.


### Orbital overlap is a result of constructive and destructive interference. When waves are in phase, the intererence "strengthens" the wave and its amplitude rises. If they are out of phase, peaks cancel each other and the wave may vanish completely.


If an s orbital approaches a p orbital from a different angle, overlap will be inefficient, if not non-existent. In the extreme case, the overlap between the two occurs like in this picture:



The p orbital has two phases, depicted by two colours - white and gray. The s orbital, though only has one phase, so it is solid white. If you calculate the area where gray and white overlaps, and then the area where white and white overlaps, you'll get the same number. However, the former produces destructive interference and the latter - constructive interference. So, the gain is the same amount as the loss and as a result no bond can be formed. Such orbitals are called orthogonal. This explains why s orbitals can only form sigma bonds but can't produce pi or delta bonds.

Indeed, p orbitals are orthogonal to each other as they lie along the three coordinate axes x, y and z. So, an s orbital can bond to one of the three p orbitals available in an atom



Now, on the part of your question regarding molecular orbital theory. We take a set of atomic orbitals from the interacting atoms and they are "mixed" to form molecular orbitals. They have different shape, size and energy. Symmetry of the atomic orbitals is still taken into account - the same rules apply.

Let me know if further clarifications are necessary.
